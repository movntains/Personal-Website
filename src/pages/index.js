              I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in
              life. If you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go
              at it full speed ahead. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love
              it, and above all, become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no
              good.

            I'm a software engineer who believes in clean, intuitive user
            interfaces and modular, DRY code. My primary focus is fullstack web
            development with React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm highly detail-oriented and organized, and I'm also a fast
            learner. I'm constantly working to improve my skills, as well as to
            increase both the breadth and depth of my knowledge.

            When I'm not coding, I can usually be found doing one of the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reading 📚</li>
            <li>Playing tennis 🎾</li>
            <li>Rooting for Philadelphia sports teams ⚾️🏒🏀🏈</li>
            <li>Watching The Big Bang Theory ⚛️ or Game of Thrones 🐺🐉🦁</li>
            <li>Enjoying/wishing for cold weather ❄️</li>
            <li>Learning Spanish 🇪🇸</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    );

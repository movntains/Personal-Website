        I was a member of the Baccalaureate Honors Program, and I was also
        honored as a Rider University Distinguished Scholar. Additionally, I
        made the Dean's List every semester but one. The program involved a
        variety of courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, all
        of which trained me to logically approach problems and honed my
        analytical and critical thinking skills.

        This program involved completing 11 courses, which consisted of 4 core
        courses and 7 electives. During my time in the program, I coordinated 4
        graduate-level group projects and presentations. I also completed an
        independent study that involved composing a 30-page report on cellular
        iron metabolism and its effects on neurodegenerative diseases. The
        courses were as follows:
